## Database Introduction

This database encompasses pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2016. It covers data from the two current leagues—American and National—as well as the four other "major" leagues: the American Association, Union Association, Players League, and Federal League, and the National Association from 1871-1875.

The database was initiated by Sean, who spearheaded the movement to make baseball statistics freely available to the public. Beginning as a solo project in 1994, it has since expanded significantly, with a team of researchers contributing to make this the most comprehensive and precise baseball statistics resource available.
